# Message Catalog

Instructions for adding to the ttkbootstrap message catalog

1. Open the file **src/ttkbootstrap/localization/msgs.py**
2. If adding to an existing catalog, locate the language and add the message as a tuple `("original", "translated")`
3. If adding a new language to the catalog, append a new instance of `LocaleMsgs` to the `MESSAGES` list using the same pattern demonstrated in the file for other languages:
```python
MESSAGES.append(
    LocaleMsgs(
        "language_code",
        ("original", "translated"),
        ("original", "translated")
    )
)
```
4. Use the language code as presented in the **LCID string** [on this site](https://wiki.freepascal.org/Language_Codes), except replace the dash with an undercore. For example: **zh-cn** should be **zh_cn**.

5. The following words / phrases should be translated for a new language in ttkbootstrap at a minimum:

    - "Ok"
